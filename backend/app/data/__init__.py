"""
HawkEye SOC — Dataset Generation & Preprocessing
===================================================
Synthetic SOC alert dataset generation (``generate_dataset.py``) and
lightweight preprocessing utilities (``preprocess.py``) for
``alerts.csv``.

This directory also serves as the backend's data directory (see
``app/config.py`` — ``ALERTS_CSV_PATH`` / ``INCIDENTS_CSV_PATH``).

Integration note: this __init__.py was added during backend integration
so the dataset engine is importable as ``app.data``. No business logic
was added, removed, or changed.
