threat_intelligence.py
=======================

Lightweight, MITRE ATT&CK-style threat intelligence mapping.

This module maps internal detection technique identifiers (the short
strings that HawkEye's detection engine attaches to raw events, e.g.
"powershell_exec") to their corresponding ATT&CK *tactic* (referred to
here as "stage") names, such as "Execution" or "Privilege Escalation".

Design notes
------------
- Pure Python, standard library only. No network calls, no LLMs.
- The mapping is intentionally a simple dictionary lookup so it is fast,
  deterministic, and trivial to unit test or extend.
- Only ATT&CK *stage names* are returned - not full technique IDs
  (e.g. not "T1059") - per module requirements.
